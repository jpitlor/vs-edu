# VS Edu

Jetbrains made a great educational platform out of IntelliJ IDEA, but unfortunately, it only covers Java, Kotlin, and Python,
so I'm making a Visual Studio variant

This extension is early in development and currently only supports 
Javascript with Jest.

# Building

To build yourself, you must have a Font Awesome Pro license. To generate
all of the icon files, run the `generate-icons` npm task.

After you do that, you can open the extension in VS Code and press F5 to
debug as normal.

# Making Tests



# TODO

There are numerous things I have planned for this extension:

- [ ] Support all popular languages
- [ ] Support custom test runners
- [ ] Add feature to generate a project/new test
- [ ] Improve performance if possible
